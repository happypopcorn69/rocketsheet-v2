# metrics.yaml
#
# This file defines derived metrics emitted by the
# ingestors.  Each entry describes how to compute
# a metric from the underlying data collected during
# parsing.  The v2 ingestor currently uses builtâ€‘in
# extractors for its core metrics, but this file
# documents the initial MVP metric definitions and
# serves as a template for future extensions.

# Frame time quantiles.  When FPS samples are
# collected, the ingestor converts them into
# frame durations (in milliseconds) and computes
# the 50th and 95th percentiles.  The resulting
# metrics use the IDs specified here.

# Last loading time.  Records the final loading
# measurement for a given session (e.g. return to
# menu).  Additional labels (e.g. Session or
# ReturnToMenu) are captured by the parser.
