# patterns.yaml
#
# This file contains a minimal set of regex patterns
# used by the MVP log ingestor.  The v2 parser has
# built‑in logic for the core Space Engineers log
# markers so this configuration is optional.  You can
# extend these definitions as needed to match
# additional line formats.

# Example pattern for loading times.  Matches lines
# like `LOADING_TIME|Session=1234ms` and captures
# the label (`Session`) and the numeric value in
# milliseconds.
LOADING_TIME:
  regex: "^LOADING_TIME\|(?P<label>[^=]+)=(?P<value>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)ms$"
  value_group: "value"
  label_group: "label"

# Example pattern for aggregates.  Matches lines
# like `AGGREGATE_GPUTime|Legend→Values` where the
# legend and values are separated by semicolons.  The
# parser splits the legend and values on `;` and
# associates each label with its numeric entry.
AGGREGATE:
  regex: "^AGGREGATE_(?P<name>[^|]+)\|(?P<legend>[^|]+)\|(?P<values>.+)$"
  name_group: "name"
  legend_group: "legend"
  values_group: "values"
